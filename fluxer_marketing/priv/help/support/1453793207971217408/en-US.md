Fluxer collects certain information while you use the platform. Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) covers what we collect, how we use it, and the controls you have. This guide explains how long we keep different kinds of data and why we retain it.

## What must stay on file

We keep the information that helps us create your account, deliver Fluxer, meet our commitments, and comply with the law. This includes your username, email address, phone number, and basic usage data. The rest is optional, and you can remove it if you choose.

## Information you can delete directly from the services

You can remove anything you have posted while you still have access to the space where you posted it. For example:

- Delete individual messages or attachments directly inside Fluxer.
- Use our Privacy Dashboard article on <% article 1445730947679911936 %> to bulk delete your messages before deleting your account.
- If you are about to delete your account, follow <% article 1445724566704881664 %> for the full account deletion flow.

Deleted content is no longer visible to other users, though cached copies may take a short time to clear.

If you'd like our help deleting specific content, email **privacy@fluxer.app** from the email address associated with your account and let us know what you need removed.

## Information retained until your account is deleted

Most personal information stays with us for as long as you have an active Fluxer account. This helps us understand how people use the platform, fix problems, and build new features. Accounts that remain inactive for two years may be deleted automatically to keep the platform healthy.

Account deletion requests are completed after a 14-day waiting period so that deletions can be reversed in case they were made by mistake. During that time you can log in to cancel the deletion. Once the 14 days pass, we begin deleting identifying information and anonymizing the rest.

## Retention periods for specific purposes

We sometimes keep certain information longer to fulfill legal or operational obligations:

- **Age verification:** If you send an ID for an age verification appeal, we delete it within 60 days after the appeal is closed.
- **Backups:** Database backups are stored for 30–45 days and then deleted.
- **Legal and tax compliance:** Transactional records are kept for the time periods required by law (for example, tax or accounting rules).
- **Safety and security:** We retain contact details (including emails and phone numbers) for 180 days after deletion for trust and safety purposes. If an account is flagged for Terms of Service violations, we may keep related information for up to two years to prevent repeat abuse and keep Fluxer safe.
- **Legal claims:** When you send us a support request about your data, we keep that conversation for up to five years after the ticket closes so we can defend or exercise legal rights if necessary.
- **Continuity of the service:** Even after you delete your account, the content you shared with others may remain for their access, even though it is no longer linked to you. Delete anything you still control before removing your account, or ask privacy@fluxer.app for help.

## What happens when you delete your account

Once you confirm deletion, we typically hold your account for 14 days before permanently removing it. This grace period lets you recover the account if the deletion was accidental. After 14 days, we delete identifying information and anonymize or aggregate what remains. Identifying data in backups can take up to 45 days to disappear.

We keep aggregated or anonymized information (information that can no longer identify you) even after deletion so we can understand platform trends and improve Fluxer.

## Your rights

Every user can control their information directly inside Fluxer or by contacting **privacy@fluxer.app**. If you live in the European Union, the GDPR gives you additional rights, which you can exercise through your account or by emailing us:

- Right of access to your personal data
- Right to rectify inaccurate personal data
- Right to erase your personal data
- Right to limit the processing of your personal data
- Right to data portability
- Right to object to the processing of your personal data

If you have questions about how long we keep something, want to exercise one of these rights, or need help deleting specific content, please contact **privacy@fluxer.app**.
