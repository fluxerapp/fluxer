Fluxer respects the intellectual property of every creator. We expect the same level of respect from the whole Fluxer community.

## Copyright complaints

If you believe content on Fluxer infringes your copyright, the quickest way to ask for removal is to use our report form at [https://web.fluxer.app/report](https://web.fluxer.app/report) and choose the copyright or intellectual property option. You can also email **dmca@fluxer.app** with the subject line "DMCA Takedown Request." In either case, your notice should include:

- A description of the copyrighted work you believe has been infringed.
- The precise location of the allegedly infringing material on Fluxer (message links, channel IDs, etc.).
- A statement that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by you, your agent, or the law, and that the information in the notice is accurate.
- A statement, made under penalty of perjury, that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized to act on their behalf.
- Your contact information (mailing address, telephone number, and/or email) so we can reach you.
- Your physical or electronic signature.

Do not mislead our support or legal teams. Please do not file false or malicious reports, submit multiple reports about the same material, or ask other people to report the same content for you. Repeated violations of this guideline may lead to warnings or other penalties on your account.

## Counter-notices

If you believe the content that was removed or disabled did not infringe your rights or was taken down by mistake, send a counter-notice via **dmca@fluxer.app**. A complete counter-notice must contain:

- Identification of the content that was removed or disabled and its location before the removal (message links, channel IDs, etc.).
- A statement that you have a good faith belief the content was removed or disabled because of a mistake or misidentification.
- Your contact information (mailing address, telephone number, and/or email).
- A statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the district where you live, or if you live outside the United States, the Northern District of California, and that you will accept service of process from the person who notified Fluxer of the alleged infringement.
- Your physical or electronic signature.

We cannot process counter-notices with missing or defective elements. If we identify any issues, we will notify you and ask you to submit a corrected notice.

Once we receive a valid counter-notice, we will forward it to the party that filed the complaint. If the dispute persists, the parties must resolve it in court. Unless the complaining rights holder tells us they have filed a court action against the content provider, member, or user, we may restore the removed material 10 to 14 business days (or longer) after we receive the counter-notice, at our discretion.

There are legal and financial consequences for fraudulent or bad faith submissions. Please make sure you are the rights holder or are authorized to act on their behalf before submitting a notice or counter-notice.

## Infringement consequences

We may delete or disable access to content that is alleged to infringe someone else’s intellectual property. Repeat copyright or IP infringers may have their accounts terminated, and in serious cases we may take stronger enforcement actions.
