This article explains how EU users covered by the European Union’s Digital Services Act (DSA) can exercise certain rights. Parts of the DSA only apply to online platforms and to specific types of decisions, so not every report or action on Fluxer is eligible for DSA handling.

## Reporting illegal content under the DSA

We work hard to remove violative content and bad actors from Fluxer. The easiest way to report content that violates our Terms of Service or Community Guidelines is through our in-app reporting surfaces inside Fluxer. Certain EU users also have the option to flag illegal content under the DSA through our web form at [https://web.fluxer.app/report](https://web.fluxer.app/report).

## DSA appeals rights

If the DSA applies to you and you disagree with one of the decisions listed below, you have six months from the date of the violation notice to appeal through our internal appeals process. You can find the link to appeal on the notice itself.

The DSA appeals mechanisms only apply to decisions that are based on a finding that the information provided is illegal or violates our Terms of Service, such as:

- removing or disabling access to content, or restricting its visibility;
- suspending or terminating access to Fluxer (either in whole or in part);
- suspending or terminating a user’s Fluxer account;
- suspending, terminating, or restricting a user’s ability to monetize their Fluxer activity.

## Out-of-court dispute settlement

You may also have the option of choosing an out-of-court settlement body that has been certified by a Digital Services Coordinator in an EU Member State to help resolve a dispute related to any of the decisions listed above. [The European Commission](https://commission.europa.eu/index) maintains a website that lists those settlement bodies as they become certified.

Fluxer will cooperate with such a settlement body when required by law, but we are not bound by the decisions they issue. We also reserve the right not to engage with an out-of-court settlement body if the same dispute (same information and grounds) has already been resolved.
