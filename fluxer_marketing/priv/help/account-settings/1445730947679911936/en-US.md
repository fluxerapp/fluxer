Fluxer gives you control over your data. You can delete your messages and other content at any time through the Privacy Dashboard or by contacting our privacy team.

## What happens to your messages

When you delete your account, all your messages will remain on the platform unless you opt to delete them first. We provide several ways to delete your messages:

### Delete all messages through Privacy Dashboard

The quickest way to delete all your messages is through the Privacy Dashboard:

1. Log in to your Fluxer account at [web.fluxer.app/login](https://web.fluxer.app/login).
2. Press the cogwheel icon in the bottom-left corner to open Settings.
3. Navigate to **Privacy Dashboard**.
4. Select the **Data Deletion** tab.
5. Click **Delete all my messages**.

Mass-deletion requests are processed in the background and will complete fully as soon as possible, relative to the total volume of messages you have sent.

### Request specific data deletion

If you want to delete specific data without deleting all your messages, you can email **privacy@fluxer.app** from your account's registered email address. Our privacy team will process your request and assist you with deleting the specific data you indicate.

## Important information

### Attachments and deletion

When you delete a message containing attachments, the attachments will also be deleted. If you wish to keep your attachments, make sure to <% article 1445731738851475456 %> before deleting messages. Attachments also expire based on size; see <% article 1447193503661555712 %> for how long links last and how to extend them.

### Timing matters

You cannot delete your messages after you've deleted your account. If you want to remove your messages from the platform, be sure to do it before initiating account deletion.

For more information about account deletion, see our guide on <% article 1445724566704881664 %>.

## Automatic account deletion

Accounts are automatically deleted if they remain inactive for 2 years. This helps us maintain platform security and manage resources efficiently.
