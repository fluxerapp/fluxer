Fluxer allows you to request a complete export of your account data, including all messages you've sent and information about any attachments.

## How to request a data export

1. Log in to your Fluxer account at [web.fluxer.app/login](https://web.fluxer.app/login).
2. Press the cogwheel icon in the bottom-left corner to open Settings.
3. Navigate to **Privacy Dashboard**.
4. Select the **Data Export** tab.
5. Click **Request Data Export**.

## What's included in your data export

Your data export package contains:

- All your user account information
- All messages you have sent across the platform
- URLs to download any attachments from your messages

## Downloading attachments

The data export includes URLs for downloading your attachments. However, you must download these attachments **before** deleting the messages that contain them.

**Important**: Deleting a message that contains attachments will also delete those attachments. If you want to preserve your attachments, download them from the URLs provided in your data export before deleting any messages.

## Receiving your data export

Once you request a data export:

1. Your request will be processed and a data package will be prepared
2. When ready, you'll receive an email at your account's registered email address
3. The email will contain a download link to a zip file
4. This download link is valid for **7 days**

## Request frequency

You can request a data export once every **7 days**. This helps us manage server resources while ensuring you have regular access to your data.

## What to do next

After exporting your data, you may want to:

- Review your message history
- Download important attachments before deleting messages. Attachments expire based on size; see <% article 1447193503661555712 %>.
- Keep a personal backup of your Fluxer data
