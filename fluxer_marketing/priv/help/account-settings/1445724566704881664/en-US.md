If you want to take a break from Fluxer or leave the platform entirely, you can either disable or delete your account. Here's what each option does and how to access them.

## How to access account options

1. Log in to your Fluxer account at [web.fluxer.app/login](https://web.fluxer.app/login).
2. Press the cogwheel icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen to open Settings.
3. Navigate to **Security & Login**.
4. Choose either **Delete account** or **Disable account**.

## Deleting your account

Deleting your account schedules a permanent deletion in **14 days**. During this period, you can cancel the pending deletion by logging into your account again.

After the 14-day period, your account and associated data will be permanently removed and cannot be recovered.

**Important**: Accounts are automatically deleted if they remain inactive for 2 years.

### What happens to your messages

When you delete your account, all your messages will remain on the platform unless you delete them first. You have several options:

- **Delete all messages**: Use the Privacy Dashboard to delete all your messages at once. See our guide on <% article 1445730947679911936 %> for detailed instructions.
- **Export your data first**: Before deleting messages, you may want to export your data to keep a personal backup. Learn more about <% article 1445731738851475456 %>.
- **Request specific data deletion**: Contact **privacy@fluxer.app** from your registered email address if you want to delete specific data without deleting everything.

**Important**: You cannot delete your messages after you've deleted your account. Be sure to handle your data before initiating account deletion.

## Disabling your account

Disabling your account simply logs you out of all devices. Your account remains on the platform but is inaccessible until you log in again.

You can log in at any time in the future to re-enable your account and pick up where you left off.
