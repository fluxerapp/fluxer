Your date of birth helps us keep your account secure and apply age-based features correctly. Because of that, it can't be edited directly in the app. If something is wrong and you need it updated, our support team can help.

## What you'll need

When you contact support, please have:
- A valid government-issued ID so we can verify your identity
- The correct date of birth you want on your account
- A short explanation of why it needs to be changed (for example, a typo during sign-up)

## How to contact support

1. Email us at support@fluxer.app from the email address linked to your Fluxer account.
2. Use the subject line: `Date of birth change request`.
3. In the email, include:
   - The correct date of birth
   - Why the current date of birth is wrong
   - A clear photo of your government-issued ID as an attachment

## After you send your request

1. Our support team will review your request, usually within **24–48 hours**.
2. We may ask for additional details if something is unclear.
3. Once everything is verified, we'll update the date of birth on your account.
4. You'll get a confirmation email when the change is complete.

Most requests are fully processed within **2–3 business days**.

## Things to know

- **Limited changes**: For security reasons, we generally allow only one date of birth change per account.
- **Age requirements**: If the new date of birth changes your eligibility for certain features, your access may be updated to match.
- **ID handling**: Any ID you send is handled securely and deleted after the verification process is complete.

## Age-restricted features

Changing your date of birth may affect access to:
- Age-restricted channels and communities
- Certain platform features
- Content filters and safety settings
