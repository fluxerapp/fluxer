## Welcome to Fluxer

Fluxer is a platform designed for communication, connection, and community building. These community guidelines help ensure that everyone can use the platform safely and respectfully. They form an integral part of our Terms of Service, and violations may result in warnings, content removal, restrictions, or account suspension or termination.

These guidelines apply to all users of Fluxer without exception. They govern all interactions on the platform, including (but not limited to):

- direct messages;
- community communications;
- voice and video chats;
- user profiles and statuses; and
- any other areas where users interact with one another or share content.

Individual Communities may adopt their own rules, but those rules must always be consistent with these guidelines and our Terms of Service. Where there is a conflict, these guidelines and our Terms of Service take precedence.

## The Golden Rule

**Treat others with respect and consideration. If you would not want something done or said to you, do not do or say it to someone else.**

Fluxer is built for real people. Behind every username is a person who deserves to be treated with basic dignity.

## Positive Participation

We want Fluxer to be safe, welcoming, and constructive. You can help by:

- **Assuming good intent**
  When something is unclear, ask for clarification before reacting.

- **Using content warnings and age markings where appropriate**
  If you discuss potentially distressing, graphic, or adult topics, label them clearly and place them in age-appropriate spaces.

- **Setting and following clear community rules**
  If you run a Community:
  - make your rules clear, accessible, and easy to find;
  - ensure they align with these guidelines and local law;
  - enforce them fairly and consistently.

- **Onboarding new members kindly**
  Help new members understand your Community rules. Avoid dogpiling or retaliation. Use your moderation tools instead.

- **Protecting privacy (yours and others')**
  Share only what is necessary, and be cautious about exposing personal information that could affect safety.

- **Disagreeing constructively**
  Challenge ideas, not people. It is fine to disagree, but personal attacks, harassment, or demeaning behavior are not acceptable.

- **Keeping safety in mind**
  If you see behavior that looks dangerous, abusive, or clearly inappropriate, please report it rather than amplify it.

## Prohibited Conduct

These rules apply platform-wide. Communities can set stricter rules, but never more permissive ones.

The following behaviors are strictly prohibited on Fluxer and may result in enforcement action, including content removal, account restrictions, or bans.

### 1. Harassment and Bullying

Do not engage in harassment, bullying, or threatening behavior toward any person or group. This includes, but is not limited to:

- sustained harassment or coordinated attacks against individuals or groups;
- threats of any kind, whether direct or implied;
- doxxing (sharing someone's personal or identifying information without their explicit consent);
- targeted harassment, including repeated unwanted contact after being asked to stop;
- sexual harassment of any nature, including unwanted sexual comments, advances, or innuendo; and
- encouraging others to engage in harmful behavior toward someone.

We consider factors such as frequency, severity, power imbalances, and whether someone has clearly asked you to stop.

### 2. Hate Speech and Discrimination

We do not tolerate hate speech or discrimination based on any protected characteristics, including:

- race, ethnicity, or national origin;
- religious beliefs or practices;
- gender, gender identity, or gender expression;
- sexual orientation;
- disability or medical condition;
- age or generational status;
- immigration or citizenship status; or
- any other characteristic protected under applicable law.

This prohibition includes, for example:

- hate symbols and imagery used in a praising or celebratory way;
- derogatory slurs or dehumanizing language about protected groups;
- content that promotes or glorifies hateful ideologies; and
- calls for violence, segregation, or exclusion of protected groups.

Context matters (for example, historical discussion or condemnation of hate). However, we may remove content even when intent is ambiguous if it uses slurs, symbols, or narratives that are commonly understood as hateful.

### 3. Violence and Graphic Content

Do not share or promote:

- graphic depictions of violence, gore, or mutilation;
- content that promotes, encourages, or provides instructions for self-harm or suicide;
- detailed instructions or encouragement for violence or illegal activities;
- content depicting or glorifying animal cruelty or abuse; or
- content that glorifies, celebrates, or promotes violence, violent extremism, or acts of terrorism.

Non-graphic discussion of difficult topics may be allowed in appropriate contexts (for example, news or educational content) but may require content warnings and, in some cases, restriction to age-gated spaces.

### 4. Sexual Content and Protection of Minors

We have a zero-tolerance stance on child sexual exploitation.

- **Users under 18:**
  If you are under 18, you must not engage with, share, or distribute any sexual or sexually suggestive content.

- **Content involving minors (real or fictional):**
  No user may share, distribute, request, or possess sexual or sexually suggestive content involving minors (whether real, fictional, or simulated). This includes "age play" or any portrayal that sexualizes minors.

- **Child sexual abuse material (CSAM):**
  CSAM is strictly prohibited and will be reported to law enforcement authorities as required by law. We use automated tools and safety systems to detect and prevent CSAM in media where technically feasible and take immediate action when we identify it.

- **Adult content restrictions:**
  Adult content is only allowed in clearly marked 18+ spaces. Communities must:
  - apply appropriate age gates and clear labels; and
  - ensure minors cannot access or participate in 18+ spaces.
  We may restrict or remove Communities that fail to enforce these requirements.

- **Non-consensual intimate media:**
  Never share intimate images, videos, or recordings of any person without their explicit consent. This includes "deepfakes", edited or simulated content that depicts someone in an intimate context without their permission.

- **Revenge porn and sexual exploitation:**
  Sharing intimate media to shame, coerce, or harm someone, or to obtain money, favors, or other benefits, is strictly prohibited.

### 5. Illegal Activities

Do not use Fluxer to facilitate, promote, or engage in illegal activities. This includes, but is not limited to:

- distribution or promotion of malware, viruses, or harmful software;
- fraud, scams, or deceptive practices (including phishing, impersonation, and financial scams);
- sale, distribution, or promotion of illegal goods, services, or controlled substances;
- copyright infringement or other intellectual property violations at scale or in a clearly abusive way;
- hacking, unauthorized access, or cyberattacks;
- money laundering, terrorist financing, or similar activities;
- evasion of lawful blocks or sanctions using the service (for example, using Fluxer where export control or sanctions laws prohibit it); or
- any other activity that violates applicable local, national, or international law.

We may cooperate with law enforcement where required by law or where we believe it is necessary to protect individuals from serious harm.

### 6. Spam and Platform Abuse

Do not abuse or misuse the Fluxer platform in the following ways:

- sending spam, bulk messages, or unsolicited commercial content;
- creating fake accounts or impersonating other individuals or entities;
- artificially inflating community member counts, engagement metrics, or reactions;
- buying, selling, renting, or trading Fluxer accounts or Communities;
- abusing our free tier as unlimited cloud storage rather than for legitimate communication;
- initiating fraudulent chargebacks or payment disputes to obtain free services or benefits; or
- using automation, bots, scrapers, or scripts to:
  - evade limits;
  - scrape or harvest data;
  - mass-create accounts; or
  - disrupt normal user experiences.

Limited automation that complies with our policies and applicable law may be allowed where explicitly permitted by Fluxer. Otherwise, automated abuse is prohibited.

### 7. Harmful Misinformation

Do not deliberately spread harmful misinformation that could:

- endanger public health or safety;
- interfere with democratic processes or civic participation;
- cause direct physical harm to individuals or communities; or
- damage critical infrastructure or essential services.

Examples include:

- false medical "cures" that could lead someone to avoid necessary treatment;
- calls to disable public safety systems or emergency services; or
- fabricated election procedures intended to confuse or disenfranchise voters.

We may remove or limit the reach of content that is demonstrably false and likely to cause harm. When assessing content, we consider context, source credibility, intent, and potential real-world impact.

### 8. Privacy Violations

Respect the privacy rights of all users. Do not:

- share private conversations or communications without explicit permission from all parties, except where necessary to report abuse or illegal behavior to us or to authorities;
- record voice or video communications without consent where legally required;
- circumvent, bypass, or attempt to defeat privacy settings, user blocks, or safety features; or
- engage in stalking, doxxing, surveillance, or other invasive monitoring of users on or off the platform in connection with their use of Fluxer.

If you are unsure whether something violates someone's privacy, err on the side of caution and do not share it.

## Reporting Violations

If you observe conduct or content that appears to violate these guidelines or our Terms of Service, please report it. You can:

- use the in-app reporting features available throughout the platform; and/or
- email our safety team at safety@fluxer.app.

When possible, please include:

- relevant screenshots or message excerpts;
- direct links to the content, message, or Community;
- user IDs or usernames; and
- a brief description of what is happening and why it concerns you.

Please do not engage in "vigilante justice". Do not harass, threaten, or doxx others in response to violations. Report issues to us and allow our moderation team to handle them appropriately.

We may not always be able to share the outcome of our actions with you, but we review reports in good faith and prioritize situations that present higher risk of harm.

## Enforcement Actions

When we identify violations of these community guidelines or our Terms of Service, we may take one or more of the following enforcement actions, depending on severity, context, and risk:

- issuing informal or formal warnings to the account holder;
- removing or restricting access to violating content;
- temporarily limiting or disabling specific features (for example, messaging or community creation);
- temporarily suspending account access;
- permanently banning accounts from the platform;
- restricting the ability to create, own, or manage Communities;
- deleting Communities that repeatedly or seriously violate our guidelines;
- restricting access to specific cosmetic items, premium services, or subscriptions; and/or
- reporting illegal content or serious threats to appropriate law enforcement or relevant organizations.

### How We Decide

When deciding on enforcement, we consider factors such as:

- the **severity** of the violation and the potential or actual harm caused;
- the **intent** of the user (for example, malicious vs. accidental);
- the user's **prior history** of violations or warnings;
- the **risk of future harm** if no action is taken;
- whether the content affects minors or vulnerable individuals; and
- whether applicable law requires us to act in a particular way.

General principles:

- We typically start with less severe measures (warnings, content removal, temporary restrictions) for minor or first-time violations.
- We may act immediately and permanently for egregious violations, such as:
  - child sexual exploitation or CSAM;
  - credible threats of serious violence; or
  - large-scale or clearly malicious abuse, fraud, or hacking.

Automated tools may flag content or behavior for review, but enforcement decisions are made by humans, except in limited cases where we must automatically block certain content (for example, known CSAM hashes) or where automated integrity systems limit access as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

Some safety and integrity protections (such as automated CSAM blocking, spam defenses, and regional access restrictions based on IP geolocation) operate automatically. These systems are designed to comply with applicable law, including any rights you may have in relation to automated decision-making as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

No moderation system is perfect. We may make mistakes, and that is why we provide an appeals process.

## Appeals Process

If you believe we made an error in enforcing these guidelines against your account or content, you may appeal our decision.

To appeal:

1. Send an email to appeals@fluxer.app from the email address associated with your Fluxer account.
2. Clearly state:
   - the enforcement action you are appealing (for example, "7-day suspension on [date]" or "Community deletion"); and
   - why you believe the decision was incorrect, incomplete, or disproportionate.
3. Include any relevant context or evidence (for example, message IDs, timestamps, or clarifications).

For security and verification reasons:

- We can only process appeals submitted from the email address associated with the affected account.
- We cannot accept appeals submitted on behalf of another user, except where supported by law (for example, authorized legal representatives).

Additional notes:

- **One appeal per enforcement action.** Submitting multiple appeals about the same decision will not expedite review.
- **Appeal window:** Please submit your appeal within 60 days of receiving the enforcement notice.
- **During review:** Temporary actions generally remain in place while we review your appeal.
- **Response times:** We aim to review and respond to appeals within 14 days where feasible, but this may vary depending on volume and complexity.

After review, our decision on the appeal is generally final. However, we may revisit past decisions if new, material information comes to light or if we update our policies in relevant ways.

## Special Considerations

### For Teenage Users

Users must meet the **Minimum Age** to use Fluxer as described in our [Terms of Service](/terms) and [Privacy Policy](/privacy). This Minimum Age is typically 13 but may be higher in some countries.

We determine eligibility based on your approximate geographic location and applicable laws. Users who are above the Minimum Age but under the age of legal majority in their jurisdiction (for example, under 18 in many countries) are treated as younger users for safety purposes.

- We may enable enhanced safety features by default for users we identify as under 18 (for example, stricter privacy defaults or restricted access to certain features).
- Certain types of content or Communities may be restricted based on age (for example, 18+ spaces and adult content).
- Communities focused on dating or romantic relationships between minors, or that sexualize minors in any way, are strictly prohibited.
- We maintain heightened vigilance regarding the safety of underage users and may take swift action in response to reports involving minors.

If you are under 18, please be especially cautious about sharing personal information, and do not meet people from Fluxer in person without involving a trusted adult and ensuring your safety.

### For Community Owners

If you own, create, or administer a Community:

- You are responsible for the content and behavior within your Community, including user-generated content and moderation practices.
- Use available tools to keep your Community safe and compliant, such as:
  - moderation roles and permissions;
  - content and membership controls; and
  - age gates, labels, and clear descriptions for 18+ or sensitive spaces.
- Set clear, visible rules that are aligned with these guidelines and with the law, and enforce them fairly.
- You may set stricter rules than Fluxer's baseline, but not more permissive ones.
- Failure to moderate or address serious, repeated violations can lead to:
  - restrictions on your Community;
  - removal of your Community; and/or
  - enforcement action against your account.

If you are unsure how to handle a safety issue that affects your Community, you can always report it to us or contact safety@fluxer.app for guidance.

### For Parents and Guardians

We understand that online safety is especially important for younger users.

- We provide safety resources and guidance on our website to help parents and guardians understand how Fluxer works and how to support young users.
- If you have concerns about your teenager's account, you can contact our support team. We may need to verify your relationship to the user before we can discuss or take action on a specific account.
- We take child safety extremely seriously and maintain strict policies to protect young users, including zero tolerance for child sexual exploitation and grooming.

If you believe a child is in immediate danger, please contact local emergency services first, then notify us.

### Self-Harm and Crisis Content

- Do not glorify, encourage, or provide instructions for self-harm, suicide, or eating disorders.
- Supportive, empathetic conversations about mental health are allowed, but they must not:
  - include detailed methods or plans;
  - encourage others to harm themselves; or
  - shame or attack people who are struggling.
- If you see content that suggests someone may be at imminent risk of self-harm or harm to others:
  - report it via in-app tools or email safety@fluxer.app; and
  - if you know the person and can safely do so, encourage them to seek professional support or contact local emergency services.

Fluxer is not a substitute for professional mental health care or emergency services.

## Why These Guidelines Matter

We maintain these community guidelines to ensure that Fluxer remains:

- **Safe:** Everyone should feel as secure as reasonably possible while using our platform.
- **Welcoming:** People from many backgrounds and perspectives should feel respected and able to participate.
- **Enjoyable:** Communication platforms should be fun, engaging, and positive experiences, not sources of fear or stress.
- **Legal and sustainable:** We must comply with applicable laws and regulations in all jurisdictions where we operate and maintain a platform that can exist long-term.

By following these guidelines and our Terms of Service, you help us maintain a space that works for everyone.

## Updates to These Guidelines

We may update these community guidelines from time to time as:

- new features are introduced;
- community norms evolve; or
- laws and regulations change.

If we make significant changes:

- we will provide at least 30 days' notice where reasonably practicable, for example via email or in-app notifications; and
- we will maintain a changelog or archive of prior versions for reference.

Your continued use of Fluxer after updated guidelines take effect constitutes your acceptance of those changes. If you do not agree with updated guidelines, you should stop using Fluxer and may delete your account.

## Final Thoughts

The vast majority of Fluxer users engage with our platform responsibly and never have any issues with these guidelines.

If you:

- treat others with respect;
- use common sense and good judgment; and
- remember that there is a real person on the other side of every interaction,

you are very unlikely to experience any enforcement action from us.

Thank you for helping us keep Fluxer a safe, welcoming, and enjoyable place to connect and communicate.
