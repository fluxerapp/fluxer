## Welcome to Fluxer

These terms of service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding contract between you and Fluxer Platform AB (Swedish organization number: 559537-3993). We are based in Stockholm County, Sweden, and we operate the Fluxer chat platform and related services. Throughout these Terms, references to "Fluxer", "we", "us" or "our" refer to Fluxer Platform AB and our Services.

By creating an account or using Fluxer in any way, you agree to be bound by these Terms, our [Privacy Policy](/privacy), and our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines). If you do not agree to these Terms, you must not use Fluxer.

If there is any conflict between these Terms and any applicable local mandatory law, the mandatory law will prevail.

## Definitions

For the purposes of these Terms:

- **"Services"** means the Fluxer applications (web, mobile, desktop), HTTP and WebSocket APIs, related websites and domains, and any other products, software, features, or services provided by Fluxer.
- **"User Content"** means any data, text, messages, media, files, communities, reactions, or metadata you or other users submit, upload, transmit, store, or display on or through the Services.
- **"Plutonium"** means Fluxer's optional paid subscription offering that provides enhanced features and benefits.
- **"Community"** means a server, space, or similar environment created or administered on Fluxer where users can communicate or share content.
- **"Community Owners"** means users who create, own, or administer Communities and who are responsible for setting rules (subject to these Terms and our Community Guidelines) and moderating those Communities.
- **"Account"** means a user account registered with Fluxer that is associated with a unique identifier and, typically, an email address.
- **"Privacy Policy"** means our [Privacy Policy](/privacy), which explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data.
- **"Community Guidelines"** means our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines), which govern acceptable behavior and content on Fluxer.

Capitalized terms that are not defined in this section have the meaning given to them elsewhere in these Terms.

## 1. Eligibility and Accounts

### 1.1 Eligibility to Use Fluxer

You may use the Services only if:

- you meet the minimum age required in your place of residence (the **"Minimum Age"**); and
- you are legally capable of entering into a binding contract with us, or your parent or legal guardian agrees to these Terms on your behalf as described below.

We determine your eligibility based on your self-reported information and your approximate geographic location. In many jurisdictions, the Minimum Age is 13 years, but it may be higher where you live.

If you are under the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (for example, under 18 in many countries) but at or above the Minimum Age, your parent or legal guardian must review and agree to these Terms on your behalf before you use the Services.

By allowing a minor to use your Account or to use the Services with your permission, you confirm that you are the minor's parent or legal guardian, that you have reviewed and agreed to these Terms, and that you are responsible for the minor's activity on the Services.

Some countries, regions, or U.S. states have laws that require age-verification methods we are not able or willing to implement (for example, requirements to submit government ID or biometric data). Where such requirements apply, we may restrict or disable account registration and access to the Services from those regions.

We use automated systems (such as IP geolocation and similar technologies) to determine whether access to the Services is allowed from your region and to enforce regional restrictions. These determinations may be re-evaluated over time as laws or our capabilities change. We generally do not manually override these determinations, but you may contact us if you believe your access has been restricted in error. Where applicable law provides you with rights related to automated decision-making, we will honor those rights as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

You must not use the Services if:

- applicable law in your jurisdiction prohibits you from doing so;
- you are subject to relevant export control or sanctions restrictions, as described in Section 14; or
- your Account has previously been terminated or disabled by us for breach of these Terms, unless we have expressly agreed in writing to allow you to use the Services again.

### 1.2 Your Account and Security

To use most features of Fluxer, you must create an Account. You are solely responsible for:

- maintaining the confidentiality and security of your login credentials;
- all activities that occur under your Account, whether or not authorized by you, **except where applicable law provides that you are not responsible (for example, where activity results from a security incident for which we are responsible);**
- providing accurate, current, and complete information during registration; and
- keeping your Account information up to date when it changes.

You must promptly notify us at support@fluxer.app if you become aware of any unauthorized access to or use of your Account.

We strongly recommend that you:

- use a strong, unique password and change it periodically; and
- enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where available.

You are also responsible for securing the devices and software you use to access the Services and for keeping them free of malware.

Nothing in this Section 1.2 affects any non-waivable rights you may have under applicable consumer or payment laws in relation to unauthorized charges or security incidents.

### 1.3 Consumer Use and Custom Contracts

These Terms govern your use of Fluxer as a consumer and for general personal or community use.

If you or your organization negotiate and sign a separate written enterprise, business, or custom agreement with us that expressly supersedes these Terms, that agreement will govern to the extent it conflicts with these Terms. In all other respects, these Terms will continue to apply.

## 2. Using Fluxer

### 2.1 Permitted Uses

Fluxer is a communication and community platform where you can:

- send and receive messages, files, and media;
- create, manage, and participate in Communities;
- engage in voice and video communications with other users;
- build and moderate Communities around shared interests, subject to these Terms and our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines); and
- subscribe to Plutonium for access to premium features and benefits.

Your use of the Services must always comply with these Terms, our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines), and applicable laws and regulations.

### 2.2 Prohibited Uses

You must not use the Services to:

- violate any applicable local, national, or international law or regulation;
- promote, glorify, encourage, or provide instructions for self-harm or harm to others, or threaten, harass, or bully other users;

- circumvent, disable, or interfere with security-related features or access controls; or
- engage in any activity that is otherwise prohibited by these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines).

### 2.3 Service Changes and Availability

- The Services are provided without any service-level agreement (SLA). Outages, interruptions, and performance issues may occur.
- We may add, modify, or remove features, or discontinue parts of the Services at any time. When we make significant changes, we will provide notice where reasonably practicable (for example, via email, in-app notifications, or update notes).
- Certain features may be limited, unavailable, or different depending on your region, device, account type, or applicable law.
- We may temporarily limit or suspend access to the Services or certain features for maintenance, security, legal, or technical reasons.
- If we make changes that significantly and adversely affect paid features you have already purchased, you may have additional rights under applicable consumer laws, including rights to refunds or price reductions. Nothing in these Terms limits any such mandatory rights.

## 3. Your Content

### 3.1 Content Ownership

You retain full ownership of all User Content you create and share on or through the Services. Except as described in Section 3.2, we do not claim ownership of your User Content.

You are responsible for ensuring that you have all necessary rights, licenses, and permissions to submit, upload, or share User Content on the Services and to grant the rights described in these Terms.

### 3.2 License to Fluxer

To operate, secure, and improve the Services, you grant Fluxer a limited license to your User Content.

Specifically, by submitting, uploading, or otherwise making User Content available on or through the Services, you grant Fluxer a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, and sublicensable license to:

- host, cache, store, reproduce, and display your User Content;
- use your User Content to operate, maintain, secure, and provide the Services;
- adapt and modify your User Content as reasonably necessary for technical purposes (such as compression, transcoding, formatting, or re-encoding media); and
- sublicense these rights to our service providers solely for the purpose of helping us provide the Services, subject to appropriate contractual safeguards.

We will not use your User Content to:

- train AI models; or
- share it with third parties for their own independent purposes without your explicit consent, except where we are required to do so by law or legal process, or as otherwise described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

You can generally revoke this license for specific User Content by deleting that content from the Services, subject to the retention and backup periods described in these Terms and in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy), and subject to any obligations we may have to retain certain data under applicable law.

### 3.3 Content Deletion and Retention

When you delete User Content:

- we will remove it from our active systems within a reasonable period of time; and
- the content may continue to exist in encrypted backups and certain system logs for limited periods, after which it is deleted in accordance with our data retention practices.

In particular:

- Deleted content may persist in backup systems and certain logs for a limited period before it is fully removed.
- Cached files on our content delivery networks (CDNs) may require additional time to clear from all global locations.
- Attachments may only remain available for a limited time and may expire based on factors such as file size and age. Items you save to Saved Media are treated differently and are not subject to the same expiry rules as regular attachments. For the most up-to-date details on how attachment availability and expiry work, see <% article 1447193503661555712 %>.

If you plan to delete messages or your Account, download any attachments or other content you wish to keep before deletion or expiry. For information about exporting your data, see <% article 1445731738851475456 %>.

We may retain certain information even after you delete content or close your Account where we have a legitimate business need or legal obligation to do so, such as for security, fraud prevention, or compliance with legal obligations. Such retained data is handled in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

### 3.4 Content Scanning and Safety

We use automated systems and, where required, human review to help keep the Services safe and compliant with the law.

In particular:

- We scan user-uploaded media (such as avatars, emojis, stickers, and attachments) to help detect and prevent child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and to comply with our legal obligations, using tools provided by our content delivery network infrastructure. When prohibited content is detected, access to the media is blocked and we take appropriate action, which may include reporting to relevant authorities and terminating Accounts.
- We may also use automated tools and signals to detect spam, malware, and other harmful or abusive content or behavior, as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) and our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines).

Our safety and moderation systems are designed to protect both users and the integrity of the platform. However, no system is perfect, and we cannot guarantee that all harmful content or behaviors will be identified or prevented.

### 3.5 Copyright and Intellectual Property

If you believe that content on Fluxer infringes your copyrights, please notify us at dmca@fluxer.app with the following information:

- your full name and contact details;
- a description of the copyrighted work you claim has been infringed;
- the specific URL(s) or location(s) of the allegedly infringing material on the Services;
- a statement that you have a good-faith belief that the use is not authorized by you, your agent, or the law; and
- a statement that the information in your notice is accurate and that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on their behalf, plus your physical or electronic signature.

We may remove or disable access to allegedly infringing material and may notify the user who posted it. Where appropriate and in accordance with applicable law, repeat infringers may have their Accounts terminated.

If we remove content in response to a copyright notice, we may, where permitted by law, offer the affected user an opportunity to submit a counter-notice.

## 4. Privacy and Data Protection

We take your privacy seriously. Our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) explains in detail what personal data we collect, how we use it, and the rights you may have in relation to your data.

In summary:

- We do not sell, rent, or trade your personal data.
- The Services are not end-to-end encrypted. However, we use strong encryption for data in transit (for example, Transport Layer Security) and for data at rest.
- We aim to collect only the minimum data necessary to operate, secure, and improve the Services.
- Your data is primarily stored in data centers in the United States and the European Union/EEA, and certain user-generated content may be cached on content delivery networks with edge locations worldwide, as described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
- We may geolocate your IP address for security features, regional compliance, fraud prevention, and to determine eligibility for the Services.
- You can export, manage, and delete your data through your privacy dashboard and by using the tools described in our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).
- Depending on where you live, you may have rights such as access, rectification, deletion, data portability, objection, and restriction of processing.

Please read our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) carefully. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy concerning the handling of personal data, the Privacy Policy will control to the extent of the conflict.

## 5. Acceptable Use and Platform Integrity

### 5.1 Acceptable Use of Free Services

We offer a generous free tier, but we expect you to use it reasonably and for its intended communication and community purposes.

We may take enforcement action if you:

- use Fluxer primarily as unlimited cloud storage rather than for communication or community activities;
- accumulate excessive amounts of data or create unusual loads that negatively impact service quality or availability for other users;
- distribute malware or illegal content, or use the Services for malicious, fraudulent, or abusive purposes;
- use Fluxer infrastructure for command-and-control of malware, botnets, or other harmful systems; or
- deliberately attempt to stress test, overload, or degrade our infrastructure without our prior written permission.

We will not target normal users who are using Fluxer in good faith for its intended purposes. This policy exists to prevent abuse that harms the platform and other users.

### 5.2 Platform Integrity Protection

To protect the integrity and security of the Services, we actively monitor for and take action against:

- automated spam, bulk messaging, and abuse;
- large-scale or unauthorized data scraping, harvesting, or indexing operations;
- manipulation of platform metrics or engagement statistics;
- coordinated inauthentic behavior and fake engagement;
- community raiding, brigading, or mass harassment campaigns; and
- attempts to bypass or defeat our safety, moderation, or rate-limiting systems.

Violations of platform integrity may result in immediate content removal, feature restrictions, or Account suspension or termination, with or without prior warning, depending on the severity and risk.

## 6. Paid Services and Subscriptions

### 6.1 Payment Authorization

By providing a payment method to Fluxer, you:

- authorize us to charge your payment method for any Services you purchase, including recurring subscription fees where applicable;
- confirm that you have the legal right and authority to use that payment method;
- authorize our payment processor (currently Stripe) to store your payment information securely for current and future transactions, and authorize us to receive and store limited billing information (such as billing country, partial card details, and payment status) necessary to manage your purchases;
- authorize us to retry failed payments or charge backup payment methods if you have added them to your Account; and
- agree that we may share necessary payment information with Stripe and other payment providers solely to process transactions, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations.

You are responsible for all applicable taxes, fees, and charges related to your purchases, except where we are required by law to collect and remit them.

### 6.2 Fluxer Plutonium Subscription

We offer an optional premium subscription service called **Fluxer Plutonium** that provides enhanced features and benefits.

#### 6.2.1 Automatic Renewal

By subscribing to Plutonium, you agree to recurring automatic payments. Unless you cancel, your subscription will automatically renew at the end of each billing period (for example, monthly or annually), and we will automatically charge your payment method at each renewal date for the applicable subscription fee and any applicable taxes.

You may cancel your subscription at any time through your Account settings. Cancellation takes effect at the end of your current billing period, and you will retain access to premium features until that time. You will not receive a refund or credit for any partial billing period unless required by law or as otherwise described in these Terms.

#### 6.2.2 Price Changes

We may change subscription prices from time to time, including introducing different prices for new subscriptions, regions, or promotional offers.

If you already have an active, continuously renewing Plutonium subscription:

- price increases will **not** apply to your existing subscription while it remains active and in good standing; you will continue to be charged the price that applied when you started or last changed that subscription (excluding any temporary discounts that have expired); and
- we may, at our discretion, reduce your subscription price or apply discounts, and we will clearly indicate when such changes occur.

If your subscription is canceled, expires, or lapses (for example, due to non-payment) and you later start a new Plutonium subscription, the then-current price for new subscriptions will apply and will be shown to you before you confirm the new subscription.

We may provide advance notice of price changes, especially where they are significant, but changes to prices for new subscriptions do not affect the price of your existing active subscription.

Nothing in this section limits any mandatory rights you may have under applicable consumer protection laws.

### 6.3 Refunds and Restrictions

#### 6.3.1 Plutonium Subscription Refunds

You may request a refund within 14 days of purchasing a Plutonium subscription by emailing support@fluxer.app from your registered Account email address, unless applicable law grants you a longer or different cooling-off period.

After receiving a refund:

- your Plutonium subscription will be canceled, and access to premium features will end when the refund is processed; and
- we may temporarily restrict your ability to purchase a new Plutonium subscription for a period of up to 30 days to reduce the risk of payment abuse.

If you request refunds for Plutonium subscriptions multiple times, we may restrict or block your ability to purchase Plutonium again if we reasonably believe your refund requests are abusive or present an unacceptable risk of payment abuse. In exceptional cases, we may restore purchasing access at our discretion, taking into account your account history and the circumstances of the refunds.

Nothing in this section limits any mandatory refund, withdrawal, or cancellation rights that you may have under applicable consumer laws.

#### 6.3.2 Gift Code Refunds

If you purchase a Plutonium gift code and subsequently request a refund or initiate a chargeback for that purchase:

- the user who redeemed the gift code will lose access to their premium benefits, typically from the time we process the refund or receive notice of the chargeback; and
- we may notify the affected user via email or in-app notification explaining that their premium access was revoked due to a refund or chargeback related to the underlying purchase.

### 6.4 Failed Payments

If a payment fails to process:

- we will automatically attempt to retry charging your payment method a reasonable number of times;
- we may charge any backup payment methods you have added to your Account;
- we may suspend or downgrade your access to premium features until payment is successfully processed; and
- you remain responsible for any unpaid amounts owed to Fluxer.

We are not responsible for any fees, charges, penalties, or interest imposed by your bank, payment provider, or financial institution in connection with failed payments or chargebacks.

### 6.5 Chargebacks and Payment Disputes

If you believe there is an error or unauthorized charge on your Account, we encourage you to contact us first at support@fluxer.app so we can investigate and attempt to resolve the issue quickly.

If you initiate a chargeback or payment dispute with your bank or payment provider for a payment made to Fluxer, we may:

- temporarily suspend or restrict your access to paid features while the dispute is investigated; and
- limit your ability to make future purchases if we reasonably believe the dispute is unfounded or forms part of a pattern of abusive behavior.

If a chargeback is resolved against us and we have a reasonable basis to believe it was made in bad faith or as part of a pattern of abuse or fraud, we may close your Account or permanently restrict your ability to purchase Plutonium or other paid Services. We will consider any information you provide when deciding these measures.

Chargebacks can cause significant costs and processing burdens, including penalty fees and increased fraud scrutiny from payment providers. Please contact us before initiating a chargeback whenever possible so we can try to resolve the issue.

Stripe or your payment provider may also contact you directly with receipts, alerts, or dispute notices.

## 7. Third-Party Services

Fluxer integrates with and relies upon various third-party services to provide the Services, including hosting and infrastructure providers, payment processors, content delivery networks, security services, and communication platforms.

For a description of the categories of third-party services we use and how they handle data, please see our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

These third-party services have their own independent terms of service and privacy policies. Your use of such services may be subject to those additional terms. Fluxer is not responsible for the content, availability, policies, or practices of third-party services.

Some integrations involve you interacting directly with third-party content (for example, playing an embedded YouTube video). In those cases, the third party may receive information directly from your device and process it as an independent controller under its own terms and privacy policy.

Where required by law or by the terms of our agreements with providers that process personal data on our behalf, we may share limited information with them to provide the Services, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations. We will do so in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy).

## 8. Account Termination and Inactivity

### 8.1 Voluntary Account Deletion

You may delete your Fluxer Account at any time through your Account settings. While we will be sorry to see you go, we respect your choice and will process your deletion request in accordance with our data retention practices and applicable law. For details about the deletion process, including any grace period during which you can cancel deletion, see <% article 1445724566704881664 %>.

### 8.2 Suspension and Termination by Fluxer

We may suspend or permanently terminate Accounts, or restrict access to the Services, if we reasonably believe that:

- the Account or user has violated these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines);
- the Account has been used to engage in illegal activities or to facilitate unlawful conduct;
- the Services are being abused, including through spam, fraud, or other malicious behavior;
- the Account is involved in fraudulent chargebacks, payment disputes, or other payment abuse; or
- it is necessary to do so for security, platform integrity, or legal compliance reasons.

We will typically provide advance warning before suspending or terminating an Account, unless the violation is severe, poses immediate risk to our platform or users, involves illegal conduct, or we are legally prohibited from providing notice.

If we terminate your Account for cause, you may lose access to your User Content and any associated data, subject to applicable law and our data retention practices.

If you believe we have made a mistake in suspending or terminating your Account, you may appeal in accordance with our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines), for example by emailing appeals@fluxer.app from the email address associated with your Account.

### 8.3 Account Inactivity and Deletion

To protect user privacy and manage resources, we may delete inactive Accounts in accordance with our data retention and deletion practices.

- When an Account has been inactive (no sign-ins or other meaningful activity) for an extended period, it may be scheduled for deletion.
- Where feasible, we will provide advance notice to the registered email address of the Account before deletion due to inactivity.
- The current criteria for inactivity, any applicable notice periods, and deletion timelines are described in our help articles <% article 1445724566704881664 %> and <% article 1445730947679911936 %>.

When an Account is deleted:

- messages and content you posted in Communities or direct messages may remain visible to other users, unless you delete them first (for example, via your Privacy Dashboard or other tools we provide); and
- you may no longer be able to access your User Content, unless you exported or downloaded it beforehand.

You can remove messages and other content through your Privacy Dashboard or by contacting privacy@fluxer.app before deletion, subject to technical and legal limitations.

## 9. Disclaimers, Limitation of Liability, and Indemnification

### 9.1 No Warranties

We work diligently to maintain Fluxer as a reliable and stable platform, but the Services are provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Fluxer and its affiliates make no express or implied warranties or representations about the Services, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or that the Services will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free.

We cannot guarantee:

- 100% uptime or availability;
- that the Services will be free from defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities; or
- that content, information, or communications transmitted through the Services will always be delivered or stored.

### 9.2 Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Fluxer and its affiliates will not be liable for:

- any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages; or
- any loss of profits, revenues, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses;

arising out of or in connection with your use of, or inability to use, the Services, whether based on contract, tort (including negligence), statutory law, or any other legal theory, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.

To the extent we are liable under applicable law, our total aggregate liability for all claims arising out of or relating to the Services or these Terms will be limited to the greater of:

- EUR 100; or
- the total amount you have paid to Fluxer for the Services during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

Nothing in these Terms limits or excludes:

- any liability that cannot be limited or excluded under applicable law, such as liability for gross negligence, willful misconduct, or for death or personal injury caused by our negligence; or
- any non-waivable rights or remedies you may have under mandatory consumer protection laws.

If you are a consumer residing in the EU/EEA, the United Kingdom, or another jurisdiction with mandatory consumer protection laws, the limitations and exclusions in this Section 9.2 apply only to the extent permitted by those laws and do not affect your statutory rights.

### 9.3 Indemnification

To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Fluxer, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any claims, demands, actions, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:

- your violation of these Terms or our [Community Guidelines](/guidelines);
- your violation of any applicable law or regulation; or
- your User Content, including any claim that your User Content infringes or misappropriates the intellectual property or other rights of a third party.

This indemnity obligation does not apply to the extent that a claim arises due to our own breach of these Terms or our negligence, willful misconduct, or other liability that cannot be excluded under applicable law.

## 10. Dispute Resolution and Governing Law

We want to resolve disputes fairly and efficiently.

- **Informal resolution first:** If you have a concern or dispute with us, please contact support@fluxer.app first. We will try to work with you in good faith to resolve the issue informally.
- **Governing law and courts:** Unless otherwise required by mandatory local law, these Terms and any disputes arising out of or relating to them or the Services are governed by Swedish law, without regard to its conflict-of-law rules. Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Services will be submitted to the courts of Stockholm, Sweden, which will have exclusive jurisdiction, subject to the small-claims provision below.
- **Small claims:** Either party may bring an individual claim in a competent small-claims court in a jurisdiction where venue is proper, instead of in the courts of Stockholm, Sweden.
- **Consumers in the EU/EEA and other regions:** If you are a consumer residing in the EU, EEA, or another jurisdiction that grants you mandatory rights to bring claims in the courts of your country of residence, nothing in these Terms limits those rights.
- **Class and representative actions:** To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any claims must be brought on an individual basis, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any class, collective, or representative action. If a waiver of class or representative actions is not enforceable for a particular claim, that claim may proceed as required by law in a court with proper jurisdiction, and the class or representative aspects of that claim will be handled as that court determines.

Nothing in this Section 10 prevents either party from seeking interim or injunctive relief from a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent or stop ongoing or imminent harm.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update or modify these Terms from time to time, for example to reflect changes in our Services, legal requirements, or business practices.

If we make significant changes to these Terms, we will:

- provide at least 30 days' advance notice, where reasonably practicable, via email, in-app notifications, or by posting a notice on our website; and
- make the updated Terms available, indicating the date on which they take effect.

We maintain a changelog or archive of prior versions of these Terms for reference.

Your continued use of the Services after the updated Terms take effect constitutes your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree to the updated Terms, you must stop using the Services and, if you wish, delete your Account before the changes take effect.

## 12. Account Communications and Verification

All account-related communications with Fluxer should be sent from the email address associated with your Account. We use this as our primary method of verifying your identity and ensuring we are communicating with the actual Account holder.

For security reasons, we normally only provide account support, share sensitive information, or make changes to your Account when you contact us from that email address. If you lose access to your registered email address, we may need additional information to verify your identity and might not always be able to recover or modify your Account.

Fluxer will never ask you to provide your password, full payment card number, or other highly sensitive security information via email. All official Fluxer emails originate from addresses ending in `@fluxer.app`. Be cautious of phishing attempts using similar-looking domain names or requesting sensitive information.

If you receive a suspicious message claiming to be from Fluxer, please do not click any links or provide any information. Instead, contact us directly at support@fluxer.app.

## 14. Export Controls and Sanctions

You must comply with all applicable export control, sanctions, and related laws and regulations when using the Services.

In particular:

- You may not use the Services if you are located in, or are ordinarily resident in, a country or region subject to comprehensive embargoes or similar sanctions, or if you are on any applicable sanctions, denied-party, or restricted lists maintained by relevant authorities.
