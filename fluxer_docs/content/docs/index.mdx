title: Introduction
description: Welcome to the Fluxer API documentation
---

Learn how to talk to Fluxer from code: build bots, wire up automations, and plug Fluxer into the rest of your stack. Beep boop!

We only document the public APIs meant for you to build on. Some endpoints are used internally by the Fluxer app and may change without notice, so they're not covered here. If you're curious, the whole project is open source — you can always dig through the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/fluxerapp/fluxer) and experiment. Just remember that internal APIs may break at any time, and we don't officially support them.

## Getting Started

1. Create or log into your Fluxer account [via the web app](https://web.fluxer.app/channels/@me) or desktop app.
2. Click the cogwheel in the bottom-left to open **User Settings** → **Applications**.
3. Create your first application and copy the bot token.

Once you've got a bot token, you're ready to hit the Fluxer API. The [Quickstart guide](./quickstart) walks you through building a small bot end-to-end.

If you've used the [Discord API](https://discord.dev), you'll feel at home — Fluxer's API surface is intentionally similar (but not identical). For a quick primer on how Fluxer's API is structured, check out the [API Reference](./api-reference).
