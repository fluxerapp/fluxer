# Integration Test Environment Variables (Local Override)
#
# Copy this file to .env.integration.local and fill in your actual Stripe test credentials.
# The .env.integration.local file is gitignored and will NOT be committed.
#
# These values override the defaults in api.env for local development with real Stripe webhooks.

# ===================================================================
# STRIPE TEST CONFIGURATION (Optional - only needed for real webhook testing)
# ===================================================================
# Get your test keys from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
#
# If not provided, tests will use mock Stripe responses (API calls work, but webhooks won't)
# For full end-to-end testing with real Stripe checkout + webhooks, provide these:
#
# STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_TEST_KEY_HERE
# STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE

# ===================================================================
# NOTES
# ===================================================================
# - cloudflared tunnel is automatically started to expose API for Stripe webhooks
# - LiveKit is automatically started with test configuration
# - Tenor uses MockTenorService automatically (no API key needed)
# - All Stripe price IDs are already configured in api.env
# - This file is only needed if you want to test with REAL Stripe checkout + webhooks
